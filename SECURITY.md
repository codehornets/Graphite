# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As an early-stage open-source project, security updates will be prioritized for the latest version of Graphite. Users are encouraged to stay up-to-date with the most recent release to ensure they have the latest features and security patches.

Since the project is in active development and has not yet reached a stable 1.0 release, the versioning is fluid. The current focus is on developing the core functionalities.

We encourage users to update to the latest version to receive security updates.
