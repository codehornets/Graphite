# Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to maintaining a professional, respectful, and harassment-free environment for all contributors, regardless of their background. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and productive community focused on improving the project.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
*   Focusing on constructive, professional dialogue.
*   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
*   Accepting responsibility and learning from our mistakes.
*   Focusing on what is best for the project and the community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment of any kind.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at **devaux.mail@gmail.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The privacy and security of the reporter will be respected.

## Enforcement Actions

The project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1.  **Correction**: For unprofessional or unwelcome behavior, a private, written warning will be issued, explaining the nature of the violation. An apology may be requested.
2.  **Warning**: For a more serious violation or repeated offenses, a warning with consequences for continued behavior will be issued. This may include a temporary restriction from interaction with the project.
3.  **Ban**: For a serious or repeated pattern of violation of community standards, including harassment, a temporary or permanent ban from the project may be enforced.
